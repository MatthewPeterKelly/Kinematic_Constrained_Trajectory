function [Df, DDf, DDDf] = chebyshevDerivative(f,d)
%[Df, DDf, DDDf] = chebyshevDerivative(f,d)
%
% FUNCTION:
%   This function computes the derivative(s) of the chebyshev interpolant
%   at each of the chebyshev nodes.
%
% INPUTS:
%   f = [nState x nPoints] values at each chebyshev node
%   d = [1 x 2] domain of the chebyshev function
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   Df = the derivative of the chebyshev interpolant at each chebyshev node
%   DDf = the second derivative at each chebyshev node
%   DDDf = the third derivative at each chebyshev node
%
%
% NOTES:
%   The derivative at each node is computed by multiplying f by a
%   differentiation matrix. This matrix is [nPoints x nPoints]. If f is a
%   very large order interpolant then computing this matrix may max out the
%   memory available to matlab.
%
%   It is fairly expensive to compute the differentiation matrix, but it is
%   constant for a given order and domain chebyshev approximation. To take
%   advantage of this, the differentiation matrix is stored as a persistent
%   variable.
