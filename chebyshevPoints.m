% This function returns the n chebyshev points, over the interval d. Error
% checking has not been included on the inputs.
%
% INPUTS:
%   n = [1x1] the desired number of chebyshev points
%   d = [1x2] domain of the polynomial. Default = [-1,1]
%
% OUTPUTS: (2nd-kind chebyshev points and weights)
%   x = [1xn] the n chebyshev points over the interval d
%   w = [1xn] the n chebyshev weights for Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature
%


if n == 1, x = 0; return, end % Special case

%Compute the chebyshev points on the domain [-1,1]:
m = n-1;
x = sin(pi*(-m:2:m)/(2*m));       % Chebyshev points 

%Rescale (if necessary):
if nargin~=1
    x = (diff(d)*x + sum(d))/2;
end

%Check if weights are needed:
if nargout==2
    w = weights(n)*diff(d)/2;
end
end
